### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

#### I'm Florian, multidisciplinary designer and developer

I'm a rather curious person who loves learning new stuff and building things from the ground up. At the intersection between classic graphic design and software engineering, two fields I am passionate about, I strive for simplicity, finding harmony between functionality and aesthetics.
